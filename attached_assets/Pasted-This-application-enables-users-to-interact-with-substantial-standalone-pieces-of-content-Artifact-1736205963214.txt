This application enables users to interact with substantial, standalone pieces of content ("Artifacts") in a dedicated interface. The application will allow users to create, view, edit, and manage Artifacts such as documents, code snippets, diagrams, and more. Artifacts are designed to be easily reusable, iterated upon, and referenced, ensuring users have a seamless workflow for content management. Features include version tracking, targeted updates, and tools for making complex edits without losing historical versions.

Target Platform:
